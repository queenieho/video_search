This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## What has happened
- Connect to youtube API
- Pull thumbnails, title and description of search results
- Some styling... still not pretty
- Modal pop ups when an item is clicked

## To do
- Make the actual video play, maybe I should try the other library...
- css styling
